# Quick Start

[TOC]

1. Import the **Delight unity package** to your project. You'll have two new folders:

   `Content/` - your custom content goes here

   `Delight/` - contains the framework source code and content

2. Expand the `Content/` folder, right-click on the `Content/Scenes` folder and choose `Create -> Delight Scene` from the menu. 

3. The scene MyGameScene.unity will be created in the same folder. Open the scene and run it.

Congratulations, you've created your first scene in Delight :)
